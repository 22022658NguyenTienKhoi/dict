The King of Kamera in Africa was a proud and stern man, feared by all his subjects.<br>One day while sitting in his mud palace, surrounded by fawning courtiers and watched by a multitude of people who had come to see him, he was suddenly overcome by a sense of grandeur and loudly declared that he was master of the world and that all men were his servants.<br>“You are mistaken," said a frail voice. “All men are servants of one another."<br>A deathly silence followed the remark. The blood froze in the veins of the people assembled there. Then the king exploded in anger.<br>“Who said that!" he demanded, rising from the royal stool. “Who dares suggest that I am a servant!!"<br>“I do," said a voice in the crowd, and the people parted to reveal a white-haired old man, leaning heavily on a stout stick.<br>“Who are you?" asked the king.<br>“I am Boubakar," said the man. “We have no water in our village. I have come to ask for a well to be dug there."<br>“So you are a beggar!" roared the king, striding down to where the man stood. “Yet you have the temerity to call me a servant!"<br>“We all serve one another," said Boubakar, showing no fear, “and I will prove it to you before nightfall."<br>“Do that," said the monarch. “Force me to wait on you. If you can do that I will have not one but three wells dug in your village. But if you fail, you’ll lose your head!"<br>“In our village," said the old man, “when we accept a challenge, we touch the person’s feet. Let me touch your feet. Hold my stick."<br>The king took the stick and the old man bent down and touched the monarch’s feet.<br>“Now you may give it back to me," he said, straightening up. The king gave him back his stick.<br>“Do you want any more proof?" asked Boubakar.<br>“Proof?" asked the king, bewildered.<br>“You held my stick when I asked you to and gave it back to me when I asked you for it," said the old man. “As I said, all good men are servants of one another."<br>The king was so pleased with the Royal Servant Boubakar’s wit and daring that he not only had wells dug in his village but also retained him as an adviser.
